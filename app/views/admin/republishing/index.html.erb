      Sometimes it may be necessary to republish content to the Publishing API. This will refresh the content on the website.

    <p class="govuk-body">
      The following actions will allow you to schedule the republishing of content that was originally published in this application.
      Any linked editions will also be republished through dependency resolution.
      Try to pick the document type most focused to the scope of what you need to republish to avoid unnecessary server load.
